# VarjoGazeMouse

**Status: Research & Development**

This project is about using [Varjo.NET](https://github.com/FynnHollesen/Varjo.NET) and [eye tracking](https://developer.varjo.com/docs/get-started/eye-tracking-with-varjo-headset) to control the position of the  mouse cursor.

Next goal: Use deep learning for improved accuracy and snapping the cursor to icons.

Next step: Research the necessary skills while building a [learning project](https://github.com/FynnHollesen/UdemyDeepLearningX) along the way.
